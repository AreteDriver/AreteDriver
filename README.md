# James C. Young

**AI Enablement & Workflow Specialist**

I architect AI-enabled workflows and automation systems that convert ad-hoc experimentation into documented, scalable, production-grade operations.

---

## What I Do

- **Design AI Operating Models** — Structured outputs, validation rails, fallbacks, and telemetry baked into every workflow
- **Build Production Automation** — Systems that work reliably, not just in demos
- **Convert Chaos to Process** — Transform one-off scripts and experiments into repeatable, documented operations
- **Ship Cross-Platform Tools** — Linux-native applications with Windows support when needed
- **Enable Teams** — Tools and patterns that amplify what operators can accomplish

## Featured Projects

### [AI-Orchestra](https://github.com/AreteDriver/AI-Orchestra)
Enterprise-grade AI workflow orchestration platform. Chains GPT-4, GitHub, Notion, and Gmail into declarative automation pipelines with full observability.

### [ChefWise](https://github.com/AreteDriver/Chefwise)
AI-powered meal planning with structured LLM outputs, serverless backend, and freemium architecture. Demonstrates production patterns for AI-driven consumer apps.

### [Concept-Production](https://github.com/AreteDriver/Concept-Production)
Operational tooling for lean manufacturing concepts — takt time planning, waste observation logging, and Kaizen backlog management.

### [Linux SnipTool](https://github.com/AreteDriver/Linux_SnipTool)
Polished screenshot utility for Ubuntu. Region capture, annotation, and clipboard integration with production-grade UX.

### [EVE Rebellion](https://github.com/AreteDriver/EVE_Rebellion)
Top-down arcade shooter demonstrating data-driven game architecture — procedural audio, JSON-based content pipeline, and gamepad support.

## AI Operating Model

Every AI system I build follows these principles:

| Layer | Implementation |
|-------|----------------|
| **Structured Outputs** | JSON schemas, Pydantic validation, typed responses |
| **Safety Rails** | Input sanitization, content filtering, rate limiting |
| **Retry/Fallback** | Exponential backoff, graceful degradation, circuit breakers |
| **Telemetry** | Token usage, latency tracking, cost monitoring, quality signals |

## Now

Currently building:
- **EVE VelesEyes** — Multi-boxing suite for EVE Online with real-time window preview
- **EVE Gatekeeper** — Rust-based fleet management with ESI integration
- **evemap** — Route planner with zKillboard risk scoring
