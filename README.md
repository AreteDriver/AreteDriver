🧩 What I Do

I design and ship systems that sit at the intersection of:
	•	AI automation & workflow engineering
	•	Developer tools for Linux & productivity
	•	Full-stack AI applications (Python, Next.js, Firebase, OpenAI)
	•	Lean manufacturing analytics & operations dashboards
	•	Game simulation & systems programming

My goal is simple:
Eliminate friction. Amplify execution. Build tools that enable people to operate at a higher level.

📐 My Engineering Principles
	•	Build clear, modular systems.
	•	Favor readability over cleverness.
	•	Automate anything that repeats.
	•	Document everything that matters.
	•	Ship small, ship often, and iterate.
	•	Engineer for practical impact, not academic purity.
