## Featured Projects

### [Concept-Production](https://github.com/AreteDriver/Concept-Production)
**Lean manufacturing tooling** — Takt time planning, waste logging, and Kaizen management. SQLite analytics, IoT streaming, graph models for equipment relationships, and AI-powered improvement suggestions.

### [Animus](https://github.com/AreteDriver/animus)
**Personal AI exocortex** — Persistent context storage with vector embeddings (ChromaDB), cross-device sync (WebSocket + mDNS), provider-agnostic AI abstraction (Ollama/Claude/GPT), and temporal reasoning with episodic memory.

### [LikX](https://github.com/AreteDriver/LikX)
**Screenshot capture for Linux** — X11/Wayland support, scrolling capture, OCR text extraction, cloud storage integrations. Available as AppImage, .deb, and AUR package.
