# James C. Young

**AI Enablement & Workflow Specialist**

I architect AI-enabled workflows and automation systems that convert ad-hoc experimentation into documented, scalable, production-grade operations.

---

## What I Do

- **Design AI Operating Models** — Structured outputs, validation rails, fallbacks, and telemetry baked into every workflow
- **Build Production Automation** — Systems that work reliably, not just in demos
- **Convert Chaos to Process** — Transform one-off scripts and experiments into repeatable, documented operations
- **Ship Cross-Platform Tools** — Linux-native applications with Windows support when needed
- **Enable Teams** — Tools and patterns that amplify what operators can accomplish

## AI Operating Model

Every AI system I build follows these principles:

| Layer | Implementation |
|-------|----------------|
| **Structured Outputs** | JSON schemas, Pydantic validation, typed responses |
| **Safety Rails** | Input sanitization, content filtering, rate limiting |
| **Retry/Fallback** | Exponential backoff, graceful degradation, circuit breakers |
| **Telemetry** | Token usage, latency tracking, cost monitoring, quality signals |

## Now

Currently maintaining:
- **Argus Overview v2.5** — Multi-boxing suite for EVE Online (Linux + Windows)
- **Razer Controls v1.7** — Full-featured Razer peripheral control for Linux
- **EVE Rebellion v1.5** — EVE Online arcade shooter collection, playable on itch.io
- **Steam Proton Helper v2.0** — Linux gaming diagnostics with PyQt6 GUI
- **G13 Linux v1.3** — Logitech G13 driver with macro recording
